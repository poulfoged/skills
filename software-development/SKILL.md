## What I do

- Enforce SOLID design principles, with special emphasis on the Open/Closed principle.
- Enforce general engineering practices that apply regardless of language: the Boy Scout principle, early returns, naming clarity, real types over primitives, value objects, exception handling as control flow, and encapsulation via restrictive accessibility.
- Review code and designs for extensibility, coupling, and maintainability concerns that transcend any single language or framework.

## When to use me

Use this skill whenever creating, modifying, or reviewing code in any language — especially when the change touches extensibility (adding new variants/behaviors), class responsibilities, naming, or how errors/nulls are represented.

For C#/.NET-specific syntax and tooling conventions, see the `csharp-development` skill.

## SOLID principles

### Single Responsibility principle

A class should have one reason to change.

Rules:
- Each class owns one cohesive concern (e.g., persistence, validation, orchestration) — not several.
- Split classes that mix unrelated responsibilities (e.g., a service that both validates input and sends emails).
- Prefer small, composed classes over large ones that accumulate unrelated methods over time.

Do not:
- Split so aggressively that trivial, tightly-coupled logic ends up scattered across many single-method classes.

### Open/Closed principle (priority)

Types should be open for extension but closed for modification. This is a priority principle in this codebase — treat violations as non-negotiable findings in review, not stylistic preferences.

Rules:
- Prefer adding new behavior through new classes, interfaces, or strategy/decorator patterns rather than editing existing, working code paths.
- Avoid `switch`/`if-else` chains keyed on a type or enum that grow every time a new case is introduced; extract to polymorphism, a strategy map, or pattern matching over an abstraction instead.
- Depend on interfaces/abstractions at extension points so new implementations can be plugged in via dependency injection without touching consumers.
- Seal or otherwise close classes not designed for inheritance; expose extension only through explicit, intentional seams (interfaces, virtual members).
- Treat every recurring type-switch, or every repeated modification to the same method to support a new variant, as a hard signal to refactor toward an extension point.

Examples of Open/Closed compliant changes:
- Adding a new payment processor implementation instead of adding another branch to an existing payment type-switch.
- Introducing a new validator registered via dependency injection instead of editing a shared validation method.
- Adding a new discount strategy rather than adding another conditional branch to a pricing method that's already been modified for prior customer types.

Do not:
- Modify a stable, tested class's internals every time a new variant is needed — that's a signal to extract an abstraction.
- Over-engineer extension points speculatively; only introduce abstraction when a second variation actually exists or is imminent (avoid premature abstraction).

The Open/Closed principle applies where variation is expected or has already repeated; don't apply it preemptively to code with a single known shape. Because this is a priority principle, code review should flag Open/Closed violations even when the abstraction cost seems high — favor extension points over "just add another case" fixes.

### Liskov Substitution principle

Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering expected behavior.

Rules:
- Overrides must honor the base contract: same or weaker preconditions, same or stronger postconditions.
- Do not opt out of part of an interface by throwing a "not implemented" error from an override — split the interface instead (see Interface Segregation).
- Do not narrow accepted input types or widen thrown exceptions/errors in a derived type in ways callers of the base type wouldn't expect.

Do not:
- Use type-checking on a base-typed parameter to special-case a subtype's behavior — that's a Liskov violation waiting to surface.

### Interface Segregation principle

Prefer small, client-specific interfaces over large, general-purpose ones.

Rules:
- Split interfaces so implementers only need to implement members they actually use.
- Avoid "fat" interfaces that force partial implementations or stub/no-op members.
- Group members by the consumer's use case, not by the implementer's convenience.

Do not:
- Fragment interfaces to the point where every consumer needs three or four interfaces injected for one cohesive capability.

### Dependency Inversion principle

High-level modules should depend on abstractions, not on low-level implementation details.

Rules:
- Depend on interfaces injected via dependency injection rather than concrete classes, especially across layer boundaries (e.g., application layer depending on an infrastructure interface, not a concrete data-access implementation directly).
- Define the abstraction in (or close to) the consuming layer, not the implementing layer.
- Avoid constructing concrete dependencies directly inside business logic; resolve them through the constructor or an equivalent composition seam.

Do not:
- Introduce an interface with exactly one implementation and no plausible second one "just in case" — that's premature abstraction, not Dependency Inversion.

## Boy Scout principle

Always leave the code better than you found it.

Rules:
- When touching existing code, improve it incrementally.
- Fix nearby code smells, outdated patterns, or technical debt when reasonable.
- Refactor for clarity, even if not directly related to your task.
- Update outdated comments and documentation.
- Remove unused code, imports, and variables.

Examples of Boy Scout improvements:
- Rename unclear variables while implementing a feature.
- Extract long methods into smaller, more focused methods.
- Add missing documentation to public APIs.
- Replace magic numbers with named constants.
- Update deprecated API usage to modern alternatives.

Do not:
- Make unrelated changes that obscure the main purpose of your work.
- Refactor entire modules when making a small fix.
- Introduce breaking changes without discussion.

The Boy Scout principle applies to every change, no matter how small.

## Early returns

Always prefer early returns to reduce nesting and improve readability. Exit methods as soon as conditions are met.

Rules:
- Return early when failure conditions are met.
- Avoid wrapping the entire method body in a conditional when the method ends with it.
- Invert conditions to enable early returns when the negative case should exit.
- Reduce indentation by handling edge cases first.

Bad example (nested conditional at the end, pseudocode):

```text
function validateResponse(response, expectedStatus, clientId):
    assertStatus(response, expectedStatus)
    if expectedStatus == OK:
        result = parse(response)
        assertNotNull(result)
        assertEquals(result.clientId, clientId)
```

Good example (early return):

```text
function validateResponse(response, expectedStatus, clientId):
    assertStatus(response, expectedStatus)
    if expectedStatus != OK:
        return
    result = parse(response)
    assertEquals(result?.clientId, clientId)
```

Benefits:
- Reduces nesting levels and improves readability.
- Makes the happy path clear by handling edge cases first.
- Easier to add additional logic without increasing complexity.
- Aligns with guard clause patterns.

More examples:

```text
// Bad: nested validation
function processOrder(order):
    if order != null:
        if order.isValid:
            if order.total > 0:
                // process order...

// Good: early returns
function processOrder(order):
    if order == null: return
    if not order.isValid: return
    if order.total <= 0: return
    // process order...
```

## No abbreviated names

Always use full, descriptive names for variables, parameters, and fields. Never shorten names for brevity.

Rules:
- Write out the full word or phrase that describes the concept.
- Do not use single-letter names, acronyms, or truncations except for universally understood loop counters (`i`, `j`) in trivial loops.
- This applies to parameters, locals, fields, and type parameters, in any language.

Bad examples:

```text
ct    (instead of cancellationToken)
hc    (instead of httpClient)
repo  (instead of orderRepository)
usr   (instead of username)
```

Good examples:

```text
cancellationToken
httpClient
orderRepository
username
```

## Storage-agnostic naming for stores

Never name a class after the storage technology it uses. Classes should reflect the domain concept, not the underlying infrastructure.

Bad examples:

```text
SqlServerUserStore
ElasticsearchOrderRepository
MongoDbProductStore
RedisCacheStore
```

Good examples:

```text
UserStore
OrderRepository
ProductStore
CacheStore
```

If you need to differentiate implementations (e.g., for testing or multiple backends), put the technology name in the namespace/module/folder, not the class name.

Rules:
- The class name must describe only the domain concept (`UserStore`, `OrderRepository`).
- Storage technology (SQL Server, Elasticsearch, Redis, MongoDB) goes in the namespace or project folder, never the type name.
- Test doubles follow the same rule: `FakeUserStore`, `InMemoryOrderRepository`, `SpyCacheStore` — not `FakeSqlServerUserStore`.

## Use real types over primitives

Prefer purpose-built types over raw primitives when a richer type exists and accurately represents the value's intent. Avoid "primitive obsession."

Rules:
- Use a URI/URL type instead of a plain string for URLs and URIs.
- Use a GUID/UUID type instead of a string for identifiers that are GUIDs.
- Use strongly-typed ID types (e.g., `CustomerId`, `OrderId`) instead of a plain string or GUID when the domain has specific ID types.
- Use a date/time-with-offset type instead of a string for timestamps.
- Use a decimal type instead of a floating-point or string type for monetary values.
- Use enums instead of strings or integers for fixed sets of values.

Bad examples (pseudocode fields):

```text
webhookUrl: string          // should be a URI type
customerId: string          // should be a GUID or CustomerId
orderId: string             // should be a typed ID
createdAt: string           // should be a date/time-with-offset type
```

Good examples:

```text
webhookUrl: Uri
customerId: Guid
orderId: OrderId             // strongly-typed ID
createdAt: DateTimeOffset
```

When to keep a primitive:
- The value truly has no more specific type (e.g., a free-text name or description).
- Interoperability constraints require it (e.g., serialization boundaries where the richer type cannot be used).
- The value may contain formats not representable by the target type.

At serialization boundaries (e.g., request/response models), accept primitives if needed and map to real types in the domain model. Never propagate raw primitives deeper than the boundary layer.

## Value objects

Use value objects to encapsulate domain concepts with built-in validation, rather than passing raw primitives around. Prefer immutable value types with value-based equality (e.g., records, data classes, or equivalent) — they get equality, string representation, and deconstruction for free. If your language only offers reference types, implement equality and hashing manually.

### Requirements

- Support parsing consistently (e.g., a `Parse`/`TryParse` pair, or the language's idiomatic equivalent).
- Centralize all validation logic in a single private/internal helper.
- Call that validation helper from both the constructor (guards against invalid construction) and the parsing method (returns a failure instead of throwing).
- For non-value-equality types, override equality and hashing based on the underlying value.

### Example (pseudocode)

```text
type Email:
    value: string

    constructor(value):
        if not isValid(value): throw ArgumentError("Invalid email: " + value)
        this.value = value

    static parse(s):
        if not tryParse(s, out result): throw FormatError("Invalid email: " + s)
        return result

    static tryParse(s, out result):
        result = null
        if isNullOrWhitespace(s): return false
        if not isValid(s): return false
        result = new Email(s)
        return true

    private static isValid(value):
        return value.contains('@') and value.length <= 254
```

### When to use value objects

- The value has validation rules beyond a simple null/empty check.
- The same primitive appears in multiple places with the same validation (DRY the rules).
- You want to make illegal states unrepresentable.
- The type benefits from parsing logic that belongs with the data, not scattered across callers.

## Exception handling and control flow

Avoid using exceptions (or your language's equivalent panics/errors) for control flow. Prefer explicit return types that communicate success or failure.

Rules:
- Do not throw exceptions for expected conditions or business rule violations.
- Use result types (e.g., a `Result<T, TError>`/`Either`/`Option` type, or nullable types) to represent success/failure outcomes.
- Reserve exceptions for truly exceptional situations (infrastructure failures, unexpected states).
- Let unhandled exceptions flow up to a boundary layer (e.g., API middleware) for centralized handling.

Bad example (control flow via exceptions, pseudocode):

```text
function getOrder(orderId):
    order = repository.findById(orderId)
    if order == null:
        throw OrderNotFoundError(orderId)   // Bad: using exception for control flow
    return order
```

Good example (explicit return type):

```text
function getOrder(orderId):
    return repository.findById(orderId)     // Caller checks for null/absence

// Or with an explicit result type:
function getOrder(orderId):
    order = repository.findById(orderId)
    return order != null
        ? Result.success(order)
        : Result.failure("Order not found")
```

### Result type for flow control

If your language lacks a built-in result/either type, a small `Result<T, TError>` type can carry success/failure without throwing. Wrap it in a way idiomatic to your language (e.g., a `readonly struct` in C#, a sealed class hierarchy, or a discriminated union) exposing `IsSuccess`/`IsFailure`, the success value, and the error value.

## Accessibility — prefer the most restrictive modifier

Always declare classes, types, and members with the most restrictive access modifier possible, in any language that supports access modifiers.

Rules:
- Default to the most private/local visibility available. Widen only when genuinely required.
- Prefer package/module/assembly-level visibility over fully public for types that do not form part of a public API surface.
- If tests need access to non-public members, use your language's sanctioned mechanism for that (e.g., friend assemblies, `@VisibleForTesting`, internal test packages) — do not widen visibility to public just to make tests pass.

Bad example (pseudocode):

```text
public class OrderValidator { }   // Wrong — public when nothing outside the module needs it
```

Good example:

```text
internal class OrderValidator { }  // Correct — scoped to the module/package
```

## No regions or visual section separators

Do not use collapsible region directives or comment-based visual dividers to organize code, regardless of language.

Rules:
- Never use region/fold directives (e.g., `#region`/`#endregion`, `// region`/`// endregion`, or equivalents).
- Never use comment lines that act as visual dividers, such as repeated dashes, underscores, box-drawing characters, or other horizontal-rule-style comments.
- If code needs organization, refactor it into smaller classes or functions.
- Use proper structure and separation of concerns instead.

Why regions and visual separators are problematic:
- They hide code complexity instead of addressing it.
- They encourage large, unfocused classes or modules.
- They make code harder to navigate and understand.
- Modern IDEs provide better ways to collapse and navigate code without markup in the source.
- Comment separators are indistinguishable from real comments in diffs and reviews, adding noise without value.

If a file needs regions or visual separators to be "organized," it's a sign the unit is doing too much and should be split into smaller, focused pieces.

## Enforcement

- Use PR checklists that reference this skill.
- Enforce in code review, with particular attention to Open/Closed violations (recurring type-switches, repeated edits to the same method for new variants).
- Flag primitive obsession and exception-as-control-flow patterns during review.
